My first git repo, hurray!

Hey there, thanks for checking me out. My name's Frank and gaming is kinda my life, especially ever since I fell off a roof at my job and became disabled. So now I'm thinking about learning Java and maybe making games myself. Give me a star or a watch and maybe I'll surprise us both with something amazing!
